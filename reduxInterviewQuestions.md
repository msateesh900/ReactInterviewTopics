## React Redux

    
1. ### What is Redux?

    React is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

2. ### How do you decide whether to choose context API or Redux?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.
